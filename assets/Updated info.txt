I am Bibek Mallik, A Supervising Electrical Engineer (Promoted from Lead engineer to supervising engineer) currently leading a 70-member engineering team at K&A Engineering Consulting. My world revolves around power distribution design, grid modernization, and transforming chaotic project schedules into clean execution plans. Think of me as the guy who ensures electrons behave and people stay sane. Also now I have almost 5 years of experience at K&A.

I started my journey designing small distribution projects and, through consistency, accountability, and a questionable relationship with Gantt charts, grew into a leadership role. Today, I guide multiple engineering teams across complex utility projects, focusing on quality, speed, and client satisfaction. I believe engineering is equal parts precision and discipline — and I don’t compromise on either.

My leadership philosophy is simple:
People first. Processes second. Ego nowhere.
When my team succeeds, I succeed. I invest in upskilling engineers, building clarity in expectations, and creating an environment where challenges are tackled, not feared.

Key strengths I bring to the table:

Strategic oversight of multi-million-dollar utility projects

Quality assurance and process accountability

Data-driven decision making (yes, spreadsheets are my love language)

Mentoring and developing emerging engineering talent

Calm execution under pressure — even on days when AutoCAD crashes

Forward-thinking, but grounded in discipline and traditional work ethic, I challenge inefficiency, push for innovation, and make sure standards stay high without burning people out. I value consistency over shortcuts and results over noise. At the end of the day, electrical engineering isn’t just technical — it’s personal. The grid doesn’t improve itself. People do that.

When I'm not steering projects or coaching engineers, you’ll probably find me exploring smarter ways to integrate AI into our workflows (because if AI can automate it, why are we still doing it manually?)

Engineering excellence, process rigor, and a team that grows together — that’s what I stand for.
